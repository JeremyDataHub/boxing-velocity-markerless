## Results

Feasibility study on two subjects in real ring conditions.

| Subject | Wrist | Max velocity (m/s) | Mean velocity (m/s) |
|----------|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Subject 1 | Right | 11.41 | 6.21 |
| Subject 1 | Left  | 7.08  | 5.32 |
| Subject 2 | Right | 8.48  | 6.39 |
| Subject 2 | Left  | 4.80  | 4.74 |

Punch detection threshold identified at approximately 4 m/s, enabling automatic discrimination between effective punches and guard movements.
